# WorldGame_C :earth_africa:

WorldGame is a project created for my OOP classes. It's a console game created in C++ language :computer:. The concepts and instructions are the same as in my other [WorldGame](https://github.com/bartekw2213/WorldGame) project, the only difference is that this project is written and C++ and uses console instead of GUI.

:information_source: For more informations got to the project I mentioned before.
